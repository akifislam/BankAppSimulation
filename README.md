# BankAppSimulation
This project helped me to learn object oriented programming with java. As I created this program as a very beginner in java, my code was longer than I expected. The bank app can deposit  and withdraw. It will show interest per year depending on account types. I implemented a 'transaction history' section which shows all of your transactions with real time count. There are many scopes to develop it.
